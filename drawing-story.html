    <h1>Story</h1>
    <p>Being a fan of anime, Normal-kun sets out to join his college's anime club. In this club, he meets a girl named Teresa. I plan on most characters to have an opposite-gender counterpart.</p>
    <h1>Main Characters</h1>
    <h2>Normal-kun (M/20)</h2>
    <p>Normal-kun is your average protagonist. He is 20 years old and loves anime and video games. I'll try to make him unique by resembling me.</p>
    <h2>Teresa (F/18)</h2>
    <p>Teresa is a pink haired girl with twintails. She loves being cute, is somewhat of an otaku, and is good friends with Xandra. She doesn't mind being cute and small.</p>
    <h2>Xandra (F/21)</h2>
    <p>Xandra is a stage magician who loves performing magic tricks.</p>
    <h2>Ruby (F/23)</h2>
    <p>Ruby is a very little girl, but she's actually a full-time elementary school teacher. She became a hikikomori at age 8, but decided to become a teacher recently.
    One of her pet peeves is being mistaken as a 7 or 8 year old, although she does use her mistaken age to get cheaper admission. Her catchphrase is "I'm 23, dang it!"</p>
    <h2>Unnamed maid (F/20)</h2>
    <p>She is a maid working in a mansion. She has light blue hair and is the calm, mature type.</p>
    <h1>Supporting Characters</h1>
    <h2>Normal-kun's brother (M/17)</h2>
    <p>Normal-kun's younger brother who is not into anime.</p>
    <h2>Elizabeth (F/15)</h2>
    <p>Normal-kun's blonde older little sister. After attending a magic show by Xandra, she wanted to get into magic.</p>
    <h2>Nicole (F/11)</h2>
    <p>Normal-kun's blonde younger little sister. After attending a magic show by Xandra, she wanted to get into magic.</p>
    <h2>Unnamed boy (M/12)</h2>
    <p>A boy that Nicole hates for some strange reason.</p>
    <h2>Olivia (F/7) and Elise (F/3)</h2>
    <p>Olivia is one of Ruby's students and lives in a rich mansion. Her younger sister, Elise, loves Olivia and big hats. They love playing pretend and dress up.</p>
    <h2>Unnamed boy (M/8)</h2>
    <p>A classmate of Olivia who is one of her best friends.</p>
    <h2>Ava (F/18)</h2>
    <p>Ava is Teresa's British alter-ego who works as a maid working in Olivia's mansion.</p>
    <h2>Unnamed teacher A (M/27)</h2>
    <p>A young man who Ruby has a crush on</p>
    <h2>Unnamed teacher B (F/26)</h2>
    <p>An unmarried woman who is very helpful to Ruby</p>
    <h2>Robert (M/40)</h2>
    <p>Ruby's British cousin and has produced a lot of music starting from the 90s.</p>
