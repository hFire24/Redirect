    <h2>Pick a number.</h2>
    <article id='article' class='space'>
      <p>Remember the "NO EXCUSES!" page to get you motivated? We'll get to it later. If you're feeling lazy or lethargic, pick a number.</p>

        <p>You must create the emotion that's needed to get you off your butt and to start doing the thing you want to be doing. <strong>Think about death.</strong></p>
        <p> In a week, you could die. What if you got into a car accident? What if you got a disease that will kill you in weeks or months?
        Life is short based on your food and entertainment choices. You are living life to your fullest according to your terms.</p>
        <p>If you are going to die in the next hour, will you spend that hour procrastinating? <a class='stress' href='../brave.html'>NO</a>.</p>
      </span>
      <span id='option2' style='display:none;'>
        <p>You must create the emotion that's needed to get you off your butt and to start doing the thing you want to be doing. <strong>Think about your shadow.</strong></p>
        <p>He's just like you, except that he always does things he's supposed to be doing. It's like a shadow of your record in a racing game.
        When you really don't want to do something, especially if it's something that will help you, imagine your shadow just doing the thing you don't want to do.
        Chase after that shadow version of you if you want to be successful. That is your potential.</p>
        <p>If you don't chase after that shadow by prioritizing comfort and self-indulgence over freedom and achievement, you will live a life of regret. <a class='stress' href='../brave.html'>Chase it</a>.</p>
      </span>
      <span id='option3' style='display:none;'>
        <p>You must bypass the emotion completely. Use the 5-second rule by Mel Robbins. Do not underestimate this tactic. Simply count down from 5 to 1.
        After 1, you <a class='stress' href='../brave.html'>JUST DO IT!</a></p>
