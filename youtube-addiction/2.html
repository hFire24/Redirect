    <h2>Widen the gap before the YouTube addiction kicks in.</h2>
    <article class='space'>
      <p>You are actively trying to destroy your YouTube habit. There is a tiny gap of time between when you make decisions.
      You want to widen the gap to a point where you have enough time to get yourself to do something that's not watching YouTube.</p>
